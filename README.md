# simple-linear-regression-1-variable

This notebook is a simple linear regression Implementation of a house-price predictor with a tiny dataset of only 4 variables. Ideally, this provides a basic walkthrough of developing an intuition of the implementation of the algorithm. 
The parameters(weight and bias) are also pre-set, hence I do not use a cost function here. 
I'll update the algorithm and make it more complex with more data as I continue to progress in my Machine Learning Journey!
